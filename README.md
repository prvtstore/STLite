# STLite C++11 Standard Template Library for SQLite

DESCRIPTION

STLite is an implementation of the C++ standard template library STL for
external memory (out-of-core) computations with SQLite as Storage.

### The goals of STLite are:

- to be elegantly written with good C++11 design, STL, exceptions and RAII idiom
- to keep dependencies to a minimum (C++11 STL and SQLite3)
- to be portable
- to be light and fast
- to be thread-safe only as much as SQLite "Multi-thread" mode (see below)
- to have a good unit test coverage
- to use API names sticking with those of the SQLite library
- to be well documented with Doxygen tags, and with some good examples
- to be well maintained
- to use a permissive MIT license, similar to BSD or Boost, for proprietary/commercial usage
